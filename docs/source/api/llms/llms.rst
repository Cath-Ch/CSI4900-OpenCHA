LLMs
====




BaseLLM class sets up a base Pydantic model class with an abstract method generate, which must be implemented by any subclass. 
The BaseModel class provides data validation and parsing functionality, and it can be extended to create more specific models with their own data validation rules.



- ``generate`` : Generate a response based on the provided query.

    .. py:function:: generate(self, query: str, **kwargs: Any)

        This is an abstract method that should be implemented by subclasses. 
        It generates a response based on the provided query and any additional keyword arguments. 
        The specific implementation may vary depending on the subclass.

        :param self: The instance of the class.
        :type self: object
        :param query: The query for generating the response.
        :type query: str
        :param **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that may be required by subclasses.
        :type **kwargs: Any
        :return: The generated response.
