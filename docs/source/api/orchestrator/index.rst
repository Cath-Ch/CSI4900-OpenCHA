Orchestrator
============

The **Orchestrator** is responsible for problem solving and decision making to provide an appropriate response based on the user query. \
It incorporates the concept of the Perceptual Cycle Model, allowing it to perceive, transform, and analyze the world (i.e., input query and metadata) \
to generate appropriate responses. To this end, the input data are aggregated, transformed into structured data, and then analyzed to plan and execute actions. \
Through this process, the Orchestrator interacts with external sources to acquire the required information, perform data integration and analysis, 
and extract insights, among other functions. In the following, we outline five major components of the Orchestrator.
