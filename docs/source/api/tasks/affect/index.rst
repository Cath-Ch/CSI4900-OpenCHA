Affect
==========

This folder contains the implementation of Affect dataset connection and analysis. Different tasks access the right data, perform needed analysis
and return the results.
To use Affect in CHA, please download the sample dataset from
`data.zip <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VRb79cbNgWX0Xn-jylzFVQfudd5bKFnz/view>`_.
Next, unzip the file, and then copy the extracted “data” folder into the CHA directory.
