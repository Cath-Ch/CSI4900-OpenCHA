Introduction
============






Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) are interactive systems designed to enhance personal healthcare services
by engaging in empathetic conversations and processing multimodal data.
While current CHAs, especially those utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily focus on conversation,
they often need more comprehensive agent capabilities. This limitation includes accessing personal user health data from wearables,
ubiquitous data collection sources, and electronic health records, integrating the latest published health insights, 
and connecting with established multimodal data analysis tools.



Modules
